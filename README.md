## Install

First of all, clone the repo: 
```bash
# clone from github repo
git clone https://github.com/hitaboy/designsystem-svelte.git
```

Then, install npm dependencies:
```bash
# install dependencies with yarn
yarn 

# install dependencies with npm
npm 
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
